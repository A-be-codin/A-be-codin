- 👋 Hi, I’m Abraham 😁. It's a pleasure seeing you here.
- I am interested in software development. Most of my experience so far is in simple algorithms and some basic games. I am interested in advancing to more backend projects and maybe get into hardware as well.
- I am currently a Computer Science Student working twoards an Associate Degree, and hopefully on a bachelor degree soon 🤞. I am learning more about web-development and computer security on the side these days. Just got into the Javascript course from FreeCodeCamp 😉
- 💞️ I'd love to collaborate on open-source projects, CTFs, Hackathons, or anything else fun you may have in mind. I am excited to working with you. Please reach out if you want to team up  for a Hackathon or work together on a project.
